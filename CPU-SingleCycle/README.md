This is the MIPS processing unit that performs its functions in one cycle. </br>
This CPU can perform the following functions:</br>
lw, sw, j, jr, beq, bne, jal, lui, mflo, mfhi, and, or, add, sub, addi, slt, slti, div, mult, xor</br>
The instructions in the instruction memory correspond to bubble sort instructions. </br>
